        <p>* Technically you could access the list of lines to view some of these lines in the /Lines folder. We aren't going to stop you but we suggest that you don't, kindly :-) <br> <br></p>
        <p>* Also, if you were wondering more details about the statuses. Red means the Line Idea was taken into consideration but that's all. Orange means the line is accepted and I am visualizing where I want the line to go. Yellow means the line has started and is in active development. Green means the line is done and will be put onto the system soon. Thanks! :-) <br> <br></p>
        <p>* Lastly, you'll find the lines with the Green status on the Maphub as soon as they're done. We do this for development ease and convenience.</p>
